EXPERIENCE
Spectrum Labs
Data Scientist Aug 2022 - Apr 2023
● Trained models (LSTMs, Transformers: XLM-RoBERTa) to detect 21 unique behaviors such as Hate Speech and Self Harm which our clients rely on to classify half a billion messages on a daily basis
● Built an internal python package that executes highly parallelized, asynchronous querying of dozens of Snowflake tables that reduced latency of typical data sampling workflows from 1 hour to 10 minutes
● Built a user-friendly Streamlit web app using our internal async querying python package that enables users across teams to benefit from configurable cross-client sampling, lowering the barrier of entry for data sampling
● Redesigned the data operations workflows responsible for addressing client feedback to integrate with external
platforms (AWS, Snowflake, Jira) which increased data operations efficiency/throughput by a factor of 5
● Implemented proactive sample analysis tools for our data processes, which resulted in ~30% reduction in
company labeling costs while still achieving >90% for high confidence precision classification models
● Achieved parity by reverse engineering competitor determinations using decision tree models, allowing us to
understand their determinations and map our solutions onto prospective client traffic
Data Science Intern Oct 2021 - Aug 2022
● Generated datasets on sensitive toxic data using OpenCV and OCR (Tesseract) to scrape user report screenshots
● Advanced behavior lexicon and labeled datasets for multiple behaviors (Hate Speech, Self Harm, Insult, etc.)
RepairPal
Data Science Intern Jun 2021 - Sep 2021
● Built unsupervised classification model using K-means clustering to bin vehicle repairs into categories used in tandem to predict repair costs for any given vehicle
● Developed maintenance cost estimator (Linear Regression) to project cost of owning used vehicles over time Corning Incorporated
Process Tech Specialist Jun 2018 - May 2020
● Developed OCR system using Tesseract and OpenCV, doubling efficiency and increasing yields from 72% to 80%
● Designed automated optical inspection and database management process using Python, Shell, and VBA PROJECTS
Neutrally — Text-to-text bias neutralization 2021
● LLM (T5) fine-tuned to decrease occurrences of inappropriate subjectivity in text. Labeled dataset composed of 55,503 biased and neutralized sentence pairs generated from Wikipedia edits tagged for “neutral point of view”
● Achieves state of the art performance with a BLEU score of 94.08 for bias neutralization

SAN FRANCISCO, CA /PRODUCT (RESEARCH & ENGINEERING) /FULL-TIME/ HYBRID
Anthropic’s mission is to create reliable, interpretable, and steerable AI systems. We want AI to be safe for our customers and for society as a whole.

Anthropic’s AI technology is amongst the most capable and safe in the world. However, large language models are a new type of intelligence, and the art of instructing them in a way that delivers the best results is still in its infancy — it’s a hybrid between programming, instructing, and teaching. You will figure out the best methods of prompting our AI to accomplish a wide range of tasks, then document these methods to build up a library of tools and a set of tutorials that allows others to learn prompt engineering, as well as work with high value partners to directly solve their challenges.

Given that the field of prompt-engineering is arguably less than 2 years old, this position is a bit hard to hire for!  As a result, we ask that you share with us a specific prompt engineering project on LLMs that you’re proud of in your application!  Ideally this project should show off a complex and clever prompting architecture or a systematic evaluation of an LLM’s behavior.

How we're different
We believe that the highest-impact AI research will be big science. At Anthropic we work as a single cohesive team on just a few large-scale research efforts. And we value impact — advancing our long-term goals of steerable, trustworthy AI — rather than work on smaller and more specific puzzles. We view AI research as an empirical science, which has as much in common with physics and biology as with traditional efforts in computer science. We're an extremely collaborative group, and we host frequent research discussions to ensure that we are pursuing the highest-impact work at any given time. As such, we greatly value communication skills. 

The easiest way to understand our research directions is to read our recent research. This research continues many of the directions our team worked on prior to Anthropic, including: GPT-3, Circuit-Based Interpretability, Multimodal Neurons, Scaling Laws, AI & Compute, Concrete Problems in AI Safety, and Learning from Human Preferences.

Logistics
Company-wide hybrid policy: Currently, we expect all staff to be in our office at least 25% of the time. However, different roles may have different requirements - if this role has a different preference, it will be noted above.

Deadline to apply: None. Applications will be reviewed on a rolling basis.

We encourage you to apply even if you do not believe you meet every single qualification. Not all strong candidates will meet every single qualification as listed.  Research shows that people who identify as being from underrepresented groups are more prone to experiencing imposter syndrome and doubting the strength of their candidacy, so we urge you not to exclude yourself prematurely and to submit an application if you're interested in this work. We think AI systems like the ones we're building have enormous social and ethical implications. We think this makes representation even more important, and we strive to include a range of diverse perspectives on our team.

Come work with us! Anthropic is a public benefit corporation based in San Francisco. We offer competitive compensation and benefits, optional equity donation matching, generous vacation and parental leave, flexible working hours, and a lovely office space in which to collaborate with colleagues."""
