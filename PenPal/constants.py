EXPERIENCE
Spectrum Labs
Data Scientist Aug 2022 - Apr 2023
● Trained models (LSTMs, Transformers: XLM-RoBERTa) to detect 21 unique behaviors such as Hate Speech and Self Harm which our clients rely on to classify half a billion messages on a daily basis
● Built an internal python package that executes highly parallelized, asynchronous querying of dozens of Snowflake tables that reduced latency of typical data sampling workflows from 1 hour to 10 minutes
● Built a user-friendly Streamlit web app using our internal async querying python package that enables users across teams to benefit from configurable cross-client sampling, lowering the barrier of entry for data sampling
● Redesigned the data operations workflows responsible for addressing client feedback to integrate with external
platforms (AWS, Snowflake, Jira) which increased data operations efficiency/throughput by a factor of 5
● Implemented proactive sample analysis tools for our data processes, which resulted in ~30% reduction in
company labeling costs while still achieving >90% for high confidence precision classification models
● Achieved parity by reverse engineering competitor determinations using decision tree models, allowing us to
understand their determinations and map our solutions onto prospective client traffic
Data Science Intern Oct 2021 - Aug 2022
● Generated datasets on sensitive toxic data using OpenCV and OCR (Tesseract) to scrape user report screenshots
● Advanced behavior lexicon and labeled datasets for multiple behaviors (Hate Speech, Self Harm, Insult, etc.)
RepairPal
Data Science Intern Jun 2021 - Sep 2021
● Built unsupervised classification model using K-means clustering to bin vehicle repairs into categories used in tandem to predict repair costs for any given vehicle
● Developed maintenance cost estimator (Linear Regression) to project cost of owning used vehicles over time Corning Incorporated
Process Tech Specialist Jun 2021 - Sep 2021
● Developed OCR system using Tesseract and OpenCV, doubling efficiency and increasing yields from 72% to 80%
● Designed automated optical inspection and database management process using Python, Shell, and VBA PROJECTS
Neutrally — Text-to-text bias neutralization 2021
● LLM (T5) fine-tuned to decrease occurrences of inappropriate subjectivity in text. Labeled dataset composed of 55,503 biased and neutralized sentence pairs generated from Wikipedia edits tagged for “neutral point of view”
● Achieves state of the art performance with a BLEU score of 94.08 for bias neutralization
